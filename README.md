This is pytorch repository of "Towards Transferable Adversarial Attacks with Multi-Scale Structure-Frequency Transformations"

Note that, core functions will be updated once the paper has been accepted for publication.

# Adversarial Process
1: download data into 'input_dir',

2: download the pre-trained models' checkpoints to 'model_path',

3: run main.py to generate adversaial examples

5: evaluate the generated samples in the 'output_dir' folder
